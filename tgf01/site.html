<H2>Travel Information</H2>

<H3>Passport &amp; Visa</H3>
<P>
All foreign participants visiting Japan must carry a valid passport.
Visas will also be required in many cases. Since visa application system
is very strict and takes much time to get them. So we recommend anyone 
who needs visa should apply early enough.
If you need the invitation letter to this conference for obtaining
visa, please contact the conference office.
<P>
For further information to enter Japan, please see 
<a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/" target="_top">
the web page of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,</A> or contact the nearest Japanese
Embassy (or Consulate) or their travel agencies.
</P>
<H3>Currency and Exchange</H3>
<P>
The local currency is Japanese Yen. The exchange rate is approx. 
US$1.00=JPY110.-
<P>
Main international currencies such as U.S. Dollars, Deutsche Marks, French 
Francs and Pounds etc. can be changed at the international airports. A limited
 number of authorized banks can also change currencies. 
But some currencies are not acceptable, and banking hours are from 
 9:00 to 15:00, 
Monday through Friday except National holidays. No hotels can change 
currencies.
So <strong>we recommend you to exchange your currencies
to Japanese Yen before you leave your country or upon arrival at international
airports in Japan.</strong>
<P>
Cash is still the most popular way of payment in Japan. Credit cards are 
gradually becoming common, VISA, Master Card, Diners Club and 
American Express are widely 
accepted at hotels, major stores and restaurants.
<P>
Traveler's checks in Japanese Yen or U.S. Dollars must be exchanged for cash at 
authorized banks or major hotels.
<P>
Personal Checks are Not common in Japan.
