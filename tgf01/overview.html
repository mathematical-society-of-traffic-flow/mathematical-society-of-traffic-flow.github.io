<H2>Welcome</H2>
<P>
The Workshop on Traffic and Granular Flow '01 (TGF01) is the fourth of 
an international series of conferences held previously in Juelich (1995), 
Duisburg (1997) and Stuttgart (1999).  The committee has decided that 
the fourth TGF conference should be held outside Europe. TGF01 will be 
held in Nagoya, Japan. Nagoya is one of the most adequate city in Japan 
to have a conference, because it is the center for both research and
technology of traffic dynamics and related fields. We will welcome the new century
by getting together and discuss the traffic and granular dynamics and the
development of their technologies from the view points of both physics and
engineering.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="concept">Concept of the Conference</A></H2>
<P>
The purpose of this conference is to develop the unified view of
flow dynamics like traffic and granular media. 
Recent progress in modeling, computer simulation and phenomenology
will be presented, and the perspective for applications to traffic
control and ITS will be discussed. Topics include highway as well as 
granular flow in pipes, traffic of urban network or Internet,
and dynamics of pedestrian or collective bio motion. The importance of investigation
for the interrelations among these fields is widely growing.
This conference will offer the opportunity to stimulate interdisciplinary 
research, to bundle international research activities, and to build up an 
engaged community in these research areas.
<P>
In order to have plenty of opportunities for personal communication, we have 
restricted talks to a selection of plenary lectures by invited speakers.
These talks will be supplemented by a limited number of contributed posters,
which will give you the opportunity to present the latest scientific results
in the fields and to discuss them directly with your colleagues.
